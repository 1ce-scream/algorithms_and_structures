# C programming language practice
## Goals:
  - Learn how to program in C
  - Learn various algorithms and data structures
---------------------------------------
## Completed tasks
1. **Lesson 1**
    - **Task 1:** Enter the person's weight and height. Calculate and display body mass index using the formula I=m/(h*h); where m is body weight in kilograms, h is height in meters.
    - **Task 2:** Find the maximum of four numbers. Don't use arrays.
    - **Task 3:** Write a program to exchange the values of two integer variables:
        - using a third variable;
        - *without using the third variable.
    - **Task 4:** Write a program for finding the roots of a given quadratic equation.
    - **Task 5:** The number of the month is entered from the keyboard. It is required to determine what time of year it belongs to.
2. **Lesson 2**
    - **Task 1:** Implement a decimal-to-binary conversion function using recursion.
    - **Task 2:** Implement the function of raising the number a to the power b:
        - without recursion;
        - recursively;
        - *recursively, using the evenness property of the degree.
    - **Task 3:** The Executor Calculator converts the integer written on the screen. The executor has two commands, each command is assigned a number:  
    1. add 1;  
    2. multiply by 2;  
    The first command increases the number on the screen by 1, the second increases this number by 2 times. 
    How many programs exist that convert the number 3 to the number 20?
3. **Lesson 3**
    - **Task 1:** Try optimizing bubble sort. Compare the number of comparison operations of an optimized and non-optimized program.
Write sort functions that return the number of operations.
    - **Task 2:** *Implement shaker sort.
    - **Task 3:** Implement a binary search algorithm as a function, which is passed a sorted array. 
    The function returns the index of the found element, or -1 if the element is not found.
4. **Lesson 4**
    - **Task 1:** *Number of routes with obstacles. Implement reading an array with an obstacle and finding the number of routes.
    - **Task 2:** Solve the problem of finding the length of the maximum sequence using a matrix.
    - **Task 3:** *** It is required to go around the NxM chessboard with the knight, passing through all the fields of the board once. 
    Here the solution algorithm is the same as in the problem of 8 queens. The only difference is in checking the position of the knight.
5. **Lesson 5**
    - **Task 1:** Implement the conversion from decimal to binary using the stack.
    - **Task 2:** Add to the program "implementation of a stack based on a singly linked list" a check for memory allocation. If no memory is allocated, a corresponding message is displayed.
    - **Task 3:** Write a program that determines if the entered bracket sequence is correct. Examples of correct bracket expressions:
  (), ([])(), {}(), ([{}]), incorrect â€” )(, ())({), (, ])}), ([(]) for brackets [, (,{.
6. **Lesson 6**
    - **Task 1:** Implement a simple hash function. The input of the function is a string, the output is the sum of character codes.
    - **Task 2:** Rewrite a program that implements a binary search tree.
        - a) Add tree traversal to it in various ways;
        - b) Implement a search in a binary search tree;
7. **Lesson 7**
    - **Task 1:** Write a function that reads the adjacency matrix from a file and displays it on the screen.
    - **Task 2:** Write a recursive depth-first traversal function for a graph.
    - **Task 3:** Write a breadth traversal function for a graph.
8. **Lesson 8**
    - **Task 1:** Implement counting sort.
    - **Task 2:** Implement quick sort.
